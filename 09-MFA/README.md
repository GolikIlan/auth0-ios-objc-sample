# MFA 

- [Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-objc/09-mfa)

The idea of this project is to perform login using Multifactor Authentication providers. On iOs we currently recommend Google Authenticator. All the configurations needed to perform this, are located on the Auth0 Dashboard. 
This sample code will show you the necessary login UI to test the MFA rules.
