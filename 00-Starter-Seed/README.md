# Starter Seed

[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/ios-objc/00-introduction)

Start by renaming the `Auth0.plist.example` file in the `Auth0Sample` directory to `Auth0.plist` and provide the `CLIENT_ID` and `DOMAIN` for your app.

This is the very beginning of a series of sample projects that demonstrate how to achieve goals showed in each tutorial in the series.

This sample only contains an empty Xcode project for iOS using Objective-C, like the starting point for the rest of the samples.
